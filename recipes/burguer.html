      A hamburger (or burger for short) is a food consisting of fillings —usually a patty of ground meat, typically beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll. Hamburgers are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or chilis; condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish, or a "special sauce", often a variation of Thousand Island dressing; and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger topped with cheese is called a cheeseburger

    <h2>Ingredients :</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>2 tablespoons</strong> extra-virgin olive oil, more for drizzling</li>
      <li><strong>2 shallots</strong>, chopped (⅔ cup)</li>
      <li><strong>16 ounces</strong> mushrooms, mix of shiitake + portobello, stemmed and diced</li>
      <li><strong>2 tablespoons</strong> tamari</li>
      <li><strong>2 tablespoons</strong>  balsamic vinegar</li>
      <li><strong>1 tablespoon</strong> mirin, or ½ teaspoon maple syrup</li>
      <li><strong>2</strong> garlic cloves, minced</li>
      <li><strong>½ teaspoon</strong> smoked paprika</li>
      <li><strong>2 teaspoons</strong>sriracha, more if desired</li>
      <li><strong>½ cup</strong>chopped walnuts</li>
      <li><strong>¼ cup</strong>ground flaxseed</li>
      <li><strong>2 cups</strong><a href="https://www.loveandlemons.com/how-to-cook-brown-rice/"> cooked short-grain brown rice</a>, freshly cooked so that it’s sticky*</li>
      <li><strong>1 cup</strong> panko bread crumbs, divided</li>
      <li>Vegan Worcestershire sauce, for brushing</li>
      <li>Nonstick cooking spray, for grilling</li>
      <li>Hamburger buns & desired burger fixings</li>
      <li>Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps :</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat the olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the shallot and sauté until soft, 1 minute. Add the mushrooms and a generous pinch of salt, and sauté until soft and browned, 6 to 9 minutes, turning down the heat slightly, as needed.</li>
      <li>Stir in the tamari, vinegar, and mirin. Stir, reduce the heat, then add the garlic, smoked paprika, and sriracha. Remove the pan from the heat and let cool slightly.</li>
      <li>In a food processor, combine the sautéed mushrooms, walnuts, flaxseed, brown rice, and ½ cup of the panko. Pulse until just combined. The mixture should hold together when pinched, but it should still have some texture.</li>
      <li>Transfer to a large bowl and fold in the remaining panko.</li>
      <li>Form into 8 patties, place them on a large plate and chill in the fridge for 1 hour.</li>
      <li>If you're grilling the patties, preheat a grill to medium-high heat. Brush the patties with olive oil and spray the grill with cooking spray. Place the patties on the grill and use a spatula to press down lightly. Grill for 7 minutes on the first side, flip, and grill for 6 to 7 minutes on the second side, or until well-charred and cooked through.</li>
      <li>Alternately, cook the patties on the stove. Heat a cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Coat the bottom of the skillet with oil and cook the patties for 5 to 6 minutes per side, or until well-charred and cooked through.</li>
      <li>Remove from the heat, brush with Worcestershire sauce, and serve with desired fixings.</li>
    </ol>
